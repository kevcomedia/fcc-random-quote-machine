8. When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new
   quote and display it in the `#text` element.

   button is clicked and display it in the `#author` element.

10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the `#tweet-quote` `a` element.
    This `a` element should include the `"twitter.com/intent/tweet"` path in its
    `href` attribute to tweet the current quote.

11. The `#quote-box` wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please
    run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
